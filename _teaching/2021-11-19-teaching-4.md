Over the last decade, massively parallel DNA sequencing has markedly impacted the practice of modern biology and is being utilized in the practice of medicine. In this invited lecture, I teached general analysis techniques of single-cell sequencing data, including data QC, cell clustering, peak calling and some downstream analysis along with some examples from my recent work. In the end, I touched little bit about integrative analysis of single cell mutli-ome data, including MERFISH, 10x multiome, snm3C-seq and Paired-Tag.
