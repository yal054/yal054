Comprehensive Analysis of Single Cell Epigenomic Data	Invited lecture	talk-10	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL)	2021-11-19	Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724	https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=c-seqtec&year=20	Over the last decade, massively parallel DNA sequencing has markedly impacted the practice of modern biology and is being utilized in the practice of medicine. In this invited lecture, I teached general analysis techniques of single-cell sequencing data, including data QC, cell clustering, peak calling and some downstream analysis along with some examples from my recent work. In the end, I touched little bit about integrative analysis of single cell mutli-ome data, including MERFISH, 10x multiome, snm3C-seq and Paired-Tag.
An Atlas of Gene Regulatory Elements in Adult Mouse Cerebrum	Invited talk	talk-9	Duke Single Cell Initiative (SCI) Seminar, Molecular Physiology Institute, Duke University	2021-10-26	Durham, NC 27701	https://dmpi.duke.edu/duke-single-cell-initiative-sci	Single cell and spatial profiling is a field of dynamic, rapidly developing research that is changing the way we view previously intractable problems and which allows for the generation of completely new hypotheses. The intent of Duke SCI (“sky”) RIP is to create an environment in which ongoing research will be presented in two 30-minute talks by wet and dry lab investigators. I was invited to introduce our current effort on the comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory programs in the mouse brain, which can assist in interpreting noncoding risk variants that contribute to various neurological diseases and traits in humans.

Single Cell Analysis of Gene Regulatory Elements in the Mouse Brain	Talk	talk-1	Neuroscience 2019, Society for Neuroscience	2019-10-19	Chicago, IL	https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2019	The mammalian brain consists of hundreds of cell types that work together to carry out the diverse neurological functions. To understand how neuro circuits form and how their functions are supported by various non-neuronal cell types, it is important to identify and characterize the cis-regulatory sequences in each cell type.  Here, we employed a combinatorial barcoding-assisted single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (sci-ATAC-seq) to profile chromatin accessibility in more than 1,000,000 cells from 26 cortical and subcortical regions of the rostral mouse brain. The resulting chromatin accessibility maps reveal 125 cellular taxonomy in the neocortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, basal ganglia and striatum, and delineate highly cell-type specific usage of ~350k potential regulatory DNA elements. Further integrative analysis uncovers transcription factor networks involved in each cell type, and potential cell types involved in human neurological disease. This rich resource of chromatin accessibility in the mouse brain at single cell resolution lays the foundation for understanding the gene regulatory program in the mammalian brain.

Identification of high-confidence RNA regulatory elements by combinatorial classification of RNA–protein binding sites	Poster	poster-1	The 7th Chinese Conference on Bioinformatics & Systems Biology	2016-10-07	Chengdu, China	https://journal.hep.com.cn/qb/EN/10.1007/s40484-017-0090-9	Crosslinking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) technologies have enabled researchers to characterize transcriptome-wide binding sites of RNA-binding protein (RBP) with high resolution. We apply a soft-clustering method, RBPgroup, to various CLIP-seq datasets to group together RBPs that specifically bind the same RNA sites. Such combinatorial clustering of RBPs helps interpret CLIP-seq data and suggests functional RNA regulatory elements. Furthermore, we validate two RBP–RBP interactions in cell lines. Our approach links proteins and RNA motifs known to possess similar biochemical and cellular properties and can, when used in conjunction with additional experimental data, identify high-confidence RBP groups and their associated RNA regulatory elements.
Attend "Beyond the Genome: Cancer genomics" at Harvard Medical School	Talk	attend-1	Beyond the Genome: Cancer genomics	2014-09-10	Boston, US	https://events.biomedcentral.com/beyond-the-genome/	The conference went beyond cancer genomics to explore potential therapies and discuss translation of genomes into clinical use. The well-established bioinformatics day was also  included again and focused on cancer genome informatics and data visualization.
