<p><b><i>This web-based database provides the RNA binding sites and regulatory elements.</i></b></p>
<p>Crosslinking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) technologies have enabled researchers to characterize transcriptome-wide binding sites of RNA-binding protein (RBP) with high resolution. We develop a soft-clustering method, RBPgroup, to various CLIP-seq datasets to group together RBPs that specifically bind the same RNA sites. Such combinatorial clustering of RBPs helps interpret CLIP-seq data and suggests functional RNA regulatory elements. <a href="https://rbpgroup.ncrnalab.org/">website link</a></p>
