<p><b><i>A web portal for single-cell epigenetic datasets in human and mouse.</i></b></p>
<p>You can explore cell clusters and annotations identified from single-cell ATAC-seq, as well as genomic tracks. We also offer the downloading of candidate enhancer linked to putative target genes at cell-type resolution. For detail about the experimental or computational pipeline, please refer to our recent work published on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03604-1"><i>Nature</i></a>.</p>
