<p><b><i>A web server for searching SNPs with differential Transcription factors (TF) binding.</i></b></p>
<p>This database characterizes the allelic binding of 95,886 common human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, MAF>1% in Eeuropean and Asian populations) to 270 distinct transcription factors (TFs). The SNPs were chosen from neighboring regions (<=500 kb) of 83 risk loci of type 2 diabetes (T2D) that were identified in several genome wide association studies (GWAS). The data were generated using SNP-SELEX.</p>
