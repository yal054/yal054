Single cell and spatial profiling is a field of dynamic, rapidly developing research that is changing the way we view previously intractable problems and which allows for the generation of completely new hypotheses. The intent of Duke SCI (“sky”) RIP is to create an environment in which ongoing research will be presented in two 30-minute talks by wet and dry lab investigators. I was invited to introduce our current effort on the comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory programs in the mouse brain, which can assist in interpreting noncoding risk variants that contribute to various neurological diseases and traits in humans.
